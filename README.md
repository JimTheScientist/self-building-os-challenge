# Self Building OS Challenge
The ultimate operating system challenge

This operating system only comes with 4 commands (may change in the future for debugging):
 - halt
 - aclear
 - aview
 - aedit

20 blank commands (b1-b20) and their respective storage locations are provided.

Use those 20 locations wisely.
 
## What's the point?
See how far you can get from nothing. It's fun. Unless it isn't. If it isn't fun to you, ignore it.

## why would you do this to yourself
i love pain

but if we want to make it easier maybe i'll make a project that lets you emulate the device,
have a "state tree" (save states in a tree of changes), and have windows for viewing
memory, storage, calls, etc.
